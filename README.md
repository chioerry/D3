CSV to JSON for India Census 2011

As my project has 3 csv files and i need to merge them all to get my json.....
Running this file is a bit tricky...
==============================================================

First you need to run the command 'node run execute' in the terminal.
This is Required to get the required merged csv file.
Now you can see IndiaMerge2.csv in the input data folder.

===============================================================

now run the 'node index.js' to see that .json file is created in the outputdata folder.

As i am ignoring the inputdata folder you may not need to run merge.js
